Another app from my graduation time. Basically it's an implementation of 
Simon (named Genius in Brazil) game from the 80's with a really ugly GUI 
(lol) but its still fun. It got user registration in text file and some other stuff. The game has three levels and it's GUI was made with SWING.

I'm submitting with the eclipse project structure, so, to run, just 
checkout the project folder into your eclipse's workspace, go to 
"Import -> Existing Project Into Workspace" and select its folder. The 
main class is InterfaceGenius.java.

Good luck!
